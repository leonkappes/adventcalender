# Adventcalender

This is an simple adventcalender UI for use on an [FiveM](https://fivem.net/) Grand Theft Auto V Mulitplayer Server. This Interface is presented by the CEF(Chrome-Embeded-Framework) which is part of the FiveM Client. The Javascript of this project interacts with server and clientside game logic, written in LUA, which will be uploaded her soon.
The calender uses a CSS-Grid-Layout and is inspired by an CSS-Only Adventcalender freely available on the internet.
Ingame the calender provides the user a present for logging in daily during the month of december and the price for each day can be configured along with a message and an image which will be displayed to the user, once he opens the corresponding door.
